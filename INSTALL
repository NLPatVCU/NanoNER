INSTALLATION
    If you have supervisor access, or have configured MCPAN for local
    install, you can install via:

     perl -MCPAN -e shell
     > install NanoB2B-NED

    If not, you can, "manually" install by downloading the *.tar.gz file,
    unpacking, and executing the following commands.

                    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/programs LIB=/home/lib
                    make
                    make test
                    make install

    Note that the PREFIX and LIB settings are just examples to help you
    create a local install, if you do not have supervisor (su) access.

    You must include /home/lib in your PERL5LIB environment variable to
    access this module when running.

    If you have the super-user access, then you can install NanoB2B-NED into
    system directories via : perl Makefile.PL make make install make clean

    The exact location of where NanoB2B-NED will be installed depends on
    your system configuration. A message will be printed out after 'make
    install' telling your exactly where it was installed.
